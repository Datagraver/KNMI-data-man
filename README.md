# KNMI-data-man
Manipulated KNMI datasets for further use, like number of records, or summaries.

Still work in progress.

Here we place CSV's (with semi colon as seperator) with summaries from KNMI data.

KNMI_records_som_jaar.csv contains the number of records set for daily records (min, max for tg, tn and tx for a given day).
KNMI_huidige_extremen.csv contains the current tg, tn, tx extremes for a given day in the year, together with the year the current extreme is set.

All data is from KNMI and starts in 1901.

Data will be updated once a day at 09:30 UTC.
